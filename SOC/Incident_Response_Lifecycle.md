🔐 Incident Response Lifecycle (SOC Perspective)
1️⃣ Detect

Detect is the initial phase of the Incident Response lifecycle where the SOC identifies potential security events by continuously monitoring alerts, logs, and telemetry generated by security tools and infrastructure.
At this stage, the SOC focuses on identifying suspicious activity, not confirming an incident.

Key inputs:

SIEM alerts

EDR / NDR telemetry

Firewall, IDS/IPS logs

Cloud logs (CloudTrail, Entra ID, O365, etc.)

2️⃣ Analyze

Analyze is the phase where the SOC investigates detected alerts to determine their legitimacy.
Analysts correlate alerts with relevant logs, telemetry, threat intelligence, and environmental context to decide whether the activity is:

Benign

A false positive

A true security incident

Key activities:

Log correlation across multiple sources

Timeline reconstruction

User, host, and network behavior analysis

Severity and impact assessment

3️⃣ Containment

Containment is the phase where the SOC limits the spread and impact of a confirmed incident.
The goal is to stop further damage while preserving evidence and minimizing business disruption.

Common containment actions:

Isolating affected hosts

Disabling compromised accounts

Blocking malicious IPs/domains

Restricting network access

4️⃣ Eradication

Eradication focuses on eliminating the root cause of the incident.
The SOC ensures that all malicious artifacts are removed and that attackers cannot regain access.

Key actions:

Removing malware and persistence mechanisms

Closing exploited vulnerabilities

Resetting credentials and secrets

Applying security patches and configuration fixes

5️⃣ Recovery

Recovery is the phase where affected systems, services, and data are safely restored to normal operation.
The SOC closely monitors the environment to ensure the threat does not reappear.

Key steps:

System and data restoration from clean backups

Validation and integrity checks

Post-recovery monitoring for reinfection

Gradual reintroduction to production

6️⃣ Lessons Learned

Lessons Learned is the final phase where the SOC reviews and documents the incident end-to-end.
The objective is to improve detection, response, and prevention capabilities.

Outcomes:

Incident timeline documentation

Identification of gaps and failures

Improvement of detection rules and playbooks

Security control and process enhancements

🎯 Purpose

This lifecycle ensures a structured, repeatable, and effective response to security incidents while continuously improving the organization’s security posture.
