# SOC & Cloud Security Study Notes

This repository contains structured SOC (Security Operations Center) and Cloud Security study notes,
focused on real-world scenarios, practical understanding, and interview preparation.

The goal of this repo is to document security concepts in my own words and organize learning material
in a way that is easy to revise and easy for others to explore.
